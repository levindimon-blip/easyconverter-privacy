## Overview
Easy Converter is a utility app. The app does not require registration and does not ask you to provide personal information (such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location).

## Data Collection
We do not collect or store personal information on our own servers.  
The app does not upload user-generated content to our servers.

## Permissions
The app may request the following Android permissions:
- **android.permission.VIBRATE** — used for optional haptic feedback in the user interface.
- **android.permission.INTERNET** — used for network-related functionality (if/when enabled). The current version is not intended to use it for tracking users.
- **android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE** — used to check network availability for features that may require internet access.

## Third-Party Services
Currently, the app does not use analytics or advertising SDKs.

In future versions, we may add third-party advertising services. If enabled, such providers may collect and process technical information (for example, IP address, device identifiers such as the Advertising ID, and app interaction data) to display ads and measure ad performance. This policy will be updated before such changes take effect.

## Data Retention & Deletion
Since we do not collect personal information on our servers, we do not retain it.  
Any app data is stored locally on your device and can be removed by uninstalling the app or clearing the app’s storage.

## Security
We take reasonable measures to protect information processed by the app. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Children’s Privacy
The app is not intended to collect personal information from children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be published on this page with a new effective date.
